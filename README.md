# MultiMed

## Overview
MultiMed is a machine learning project that integrates multiple Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict three specific diseases: Parkinson's Disease, Breast Cancer, and Diabetes. Each ANN model specializes in one condition, providing reliable predictions to support early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features
- **Three Disease Prediction Models**: Trained to identify Parkinson’s, Breast Cancer, and Diabetes using respective datasets.
- **High Accuracy**: Each model is optimized for reliable predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CR1502/MultiMed.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the specific script for each disease model, such as `Parkinson_s_model.py`.
- Provide the necessary patient data as input.
- View the prediction results for each condition.

## Datasets
- `breast_cancer.csv`
- `diabetes.csv`
- Parkinson’s data

These datasets are included in the repository for training and testing purposes.
